    AdMob is a Google mobile app advertising platform.
    We allow AdMob to serve ads in our app. AdMob uses mobile devices' advertising ID to serve personalized ads based on users' interests, which involves
      collecting and analyzing user data.
    Apart from AdMob usage, we do NOT collect or share user data.
