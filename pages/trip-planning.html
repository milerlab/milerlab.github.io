                <p>This is a multi-stop trip ETA estimator with hours of service consideration. There are driver and trip
                    views in this calculator. Fill in driver's available HOS hours data at the trip start in driver view.
                    If a driver has full driving and duty hours, please check "Full Hours Available".
                    Switch to trip view. In trip view, fill in trip start time, stop appointment and required drive hours between stops.
                    Click on calculate button to get trip stop arrival, departure times and total trip hours. 
                    Wait or late hours are also calculated for a stop with appointment time window. 
                    The HOS hours left after the trip are computed to help drivers make decisions for the next load.</p>

                    <p>If trip start time is left empty, the calculator will estimate the proper trip start time. 
                    In this scenario, we assume that a driver has full HOS hours available.</p>

                    <p>If your fill in fixed cost per day, then trip calculation will produce the fixed cost for the trip by considering total hours consumed by the trip. 
                    Once you know the trip fixed cost, use formula "Profit = Revenue - Variable Cost - Fixed Cost" to find out your profit for running this trip.</p>

                    <p>All duration hours fields are in HH:mm format, e.g., 09:15 or 21:30.<br>
                    All time fields are in d:HH:mm format, e.g., 1:08:30 or 1:20:45.</p>
            
                <p>Inputs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>d:HH:mm</strong>: d (days): for trip days (1 to 9). HH (hours): 0 to 23. mm (minutes): 0 to 59</li>
                    <li><strong>Duty Left</strong>: number of duty hours left at trip start</li>
                    <li><strong>Driving Left</strong>: number of driving hours left at trip start</li>
                    <li><strong>Till Break</strong>: number of hours until next required short break</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Time</strong>: trip start time in d:HH:mm. Proper start time will be calculated if this is left blank.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fixed Cost per Day</strong>: (optional) Enter this if you would like to know the fixed cost for the trip.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drive Hours</strong>: hours of driving needed to reach the stop</li>    
                    <li><strong>Stop Hours</strong>: load/unload hours at the stop</li>    

                    <li><strong>Window Start</strong>: (optional) If the driver arrives before the window start time, they must wait (in d:HH:mm).</li>
                    <li><strong>Window End</strong>: (optional) The driver must arrive by this time. Arrival after window end time is considered being late (in d:HH:mm).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Outputs:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Arrival</strong>: estimated arrival time at a stop in d:HH:mm</li>
                    <li><strong>Departure</strong>: estimated departure time from a stop in d:HH:mm</li>
                    <li><strong>Hours Wait</strong>: Window Start Time minus Arrival Time, if driver arrives early</li>
                    <li><strong>Hours Late</strong>: Arrival Time minus Window End Time, if driver is late</li>
                    <li><strong>Trip Hours</strong>: total trip hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Duty Hours Left</strong>: estimated remaining duty hours at the end of trip</li>    
                    <li><strong>Drive Hours Left</strong>: estimated remaining driving hours at the end of trip</li>    
                    <li><strong>Trip Fixed Cost</strong>: Trip Days for Fixed Cost multiplied by Fixed Cost per Day</li>                
                </ul>
