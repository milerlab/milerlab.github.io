                <p>At the end of the month, credit card holders can either pay their entire bill or leave an unpaid balance
                    that is subject to interest until fully paid. It is important to know the amount of time until a bill is
                    fully paid, as well as the interest accrued throughout that time. You can enter the months until the
                    bill is paid to calculate the required monthly payment. High-interest credit card debt should be paid
                    off as soon as possible.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Balance Amount</strong>: the amount you owe the card company</li>
                        <li><strong>Apr%</strong>: the annual interest rate</li>
                        <li><strong>Monthly Payment</strong>: the amount you pay per month</li>
                        <li><strong>Months To Pay Off</strong>: the number of months taken to pay off the balance</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Payment</strong>: the monthly payment multiplied by the number of months to pay off</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Interest</strong>: the total payment minus the balance amount</li>
